# AuthTemplate

ASP CORE 3.1 MVC Windows Identity template without using Razor pages and scaffolding. 

This is made from scratch using Core Identity without all the headache of scaffolding from the Pages/Account and keeping it strictly MVC.
Data is in a seperate layer and also emails will be included, just put your smtp details in appsettings.json
